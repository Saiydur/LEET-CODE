# Intuition
The problem requires finding the longest common prefix among a given array of strings. To solve this problem, we can start with the assumption that the first string in the array is the common prefix. We can then compare this prefix with the subsequent strings in the array and update it by removing characters from the end until it remains a common prefix. By iterating through all the strings, we can find the longest common prefix.

# Approach
1. Initialize the prefix variable with the first string in the strs array.
1. Iterate over the remaining strings in the strs array, starting from the second string.
1. Within each iteration, use a while loop to check if the prefix is a prefix of the current string. The indexOf method is used to determine if the prefix is present at the beginning of the string (it returns 0 in that case).
1. If the prefix is not a prefix of the current string, reduce the prefix by removing the last character using the substring method. Repeat this process until the prefix is a prefix of the current string.
1. Finally, return the resulting prefix, which represents the longest common prefix among all the strings in the array.
# Complexity
- **Time complexity:** The algorithm iterates over the strs array once, and within each iteration, it compares the prefix with the current string. The indexOf method has a time complexity of O(m) in the worst case, where m is the length of the string. Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n * m), where n is the number of strings in the array and m is the average length of the strings.
- **Space complexity:** The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space to store the prefix variable. Therefore, the space complexity is O(1), which is constant.
## Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {string[]} strs
 * @return {string}
 */
var longestCommonPrefix = function(strs) {
    let prefix = strs[0];
    for (let i = 1; i < strs.length; i++) {
        while (strs[i].indexOf(prefix) != 0) {
            prefix = prefix.substring(0, prefix.length - 1);
        }
    }
    return prefix;
};
